This repository contains a notebook and the data the notebook uses to demonstrate the uses of [PyMUSAS](https://github.com/UCREL/pymusas). The notebook can be found at [./PyMUSAS.ipynb](./PyMUSAS.ipynb) and the data are the two text files.

The notebook guides use through the following (**note** even though this guide shows how to tag **English** text we do link you to a guide on how to setup PyMUSAS to tag other languages, of which we currently support 9 other languages):

- How to install and setup PyMUSAS for English.
- How to tag text whereby the text can come from a Python string variable or a file.
- How to view the POS tags in combination with it's associated tokens.
- Create histograms of the most frequent POS and tokens in your tagged text
- Compare the frequency of tokens between two texts
- Generating keyness values of tokens based off the two texts.
